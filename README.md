# Expo React Native Project

run "npx expo start" 

A coding tutorial created to review and practice basic JavaScript by creating a question and answer game. Completed through Mammoth Interactive at [link to Mammoth Interactive Homepage](https://training.mammothinteractive.com/courses).

## Tech Used
- JavaScript

## Dependencies
- React
- React Native
- Expo

## Uses
I switched this up from my first React native project which used React CLI. I found CLI a bit difficult to install and buggy. In order to play around with the components of React Native without the time spent debugging, I used Expo.

## What I did with this project
- used typescript instead of javascript
- used onChangeText attribute to display a welcome message
- figured out how to adjust th eimage width vs height ratios and created viewport and ratio constants to make it work
- found my own color scheme
- Aligned components beyond what the tutorial's guidance

## History
After completing a Software Engineering certification program and during my job search, I needed to continue to pracitce my skill set in order to maintain it and learn more. I wanted to create this project to gain some experience with the React Native. This project focused on practicing FlexBox in React Native while changing how the stylesheet was accessed (const, object or inline).
