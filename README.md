# Expo React Native Project

run "npx expo start" 

A coding tutorial created to review and practice basic JavaScript by creating a question and answer game. Completed through Mammoth Interactive at [link to Mammoth Interactive Homepage](https://training.mammothinteractive.com/courses).

## Tech Used


## Dependencies
- React
- React Native

## Uses
I switched this up from my first React native project which used React CLI. I found CLI a bit difficult to install and buggy. In order to play around with the components of React Native without the time spent debugging, I used Expo.

## What I did with this project
- used typescript instead of javascript
- used onChangeText attribute to display a welcome message
- figured out how to adjust th eimage width vs height ratios and created viewport and ratio constants to make it work
- found my own color scheme
- Aligned components beyond what the tutorial's guidance

## History
After completing a Software Engineering certification program and during my job search, I needed to continue to pracitce my skill set in order to maintain it and learn more. I wanted to create this project to gain some experience with the React Native.
